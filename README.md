# Log Enrichment Script

## Objective

The Log Enrichment Script project focuses on improving the quality of security logs by automating the enrichment of key indicators such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domains. This script adds contextual information to raw logs using open-source threat intelligence sources. The goal is to support better threat analysis and faster triage in a SOC environment using entirely free and open-source tooling.

### Skills Learned

- Python scripting for SOC automation  
- Integration of open-source threat intelligence APIs  
- Parsing, enriching, and formatting log data  
- Enhancing alerts with actionable context  
- Modular scripting practices for flexible use in SOC pipelines  

### Tools Used

- **Python** – Core scripting language  
- **AbuseIPDB** (free tier) – IP address reputation enrichment  
- **OTX AlienVault** – Open Threat Exchange for IOC context  
- **YARA** – Pattern-matching for malware indicators  
- **MISP** – Open-source threat intelligence platform for structured feeds  
- **CyberChef** – Data transformation and IOC analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code** – Script development and testing
